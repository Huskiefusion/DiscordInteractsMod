This mod originally started with the intent of being able to customize spawn-rates, but has now shifted to general interaction with the server via Discord and spawn-rates will eventually be included in that.
Not much exists in the way of interaction at this moment, but significantly more features are planned in the future.

Use !owo [player name] to kill a player
use !whuwu to get a list of active players
Both are commands you need to use in Discord.

If this doesn't work, you prob didn't set an API Key, and I'm not going to tell you how to do that, look it up (eventually I will probably make a setup guide and link it here but you can set the API key for your bot in the mod config but you DO need an API key for a bot).
Before you download this mod, there is a solid chance that there are broken features. I probably already know about them but feel free to post about them if you wish.
Eventually this mod will be slightly less of a shit-post, for instance the command naming scheme will make more sense eventually.
This mod will update frequently for a while as I try to fix (and implement) as much as I can.
If you have any ideas or questions, I would be happy to hear them! :)
